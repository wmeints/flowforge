# FlowForge

A simple yet powerful distributed workflow engine in Rust.

## About FlowForge

You can use FlowForge to build a distributed workflow into your application. This project is currently in an experimental state.
I am using Copilot Workspaces to set things up, design portions of the code, and refine things as I go.

## Features

- Define your workflow in one of your favorite languages like Python, Rust, C#, Java or Go.
- Distribute the workflow activities across several nodes to scale out your workload.
- Automatically retry failed activities.
- Schedule workflows using default or custom schedulers.

## Getting started

## Development
